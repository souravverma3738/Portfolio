            <p>The Library Management System (LMS) is a sophisticated application I developed using Java and the Swing framework, 
                aimed at streamlining library operations. This system is 
                designed to handle essential library functions efficiently,
                 providing a seamless experience for both librarians and 
                 users. With secure user authentication, the LMS ensures 
                 that only authorized personnel can manage the system's 
                 features. It offers comprehensive book management
                  capabilities, allowing librarians to add, update, 
                  delete, and search for books in the inventory. Member 
                  management is equally robust, maintaining detailed records 
                  of library members and their borrowing histories. The system simplifies the transaction process, tracking book loans, due dates, and overdue fines. An intuitive user interface built with Java Swing components ensures a smooth user experience and easy navigation. </p>

           <p> Napier-Bank Messaging Application</p>
           <div class="description">
            <p>The Napier Bank Messaging System, developed as part of the software engineering coursework at Edinburgh Napier University, is an advanced application designed to manage diverse communication channels within the banking environment. This system facilitates the efficient handling of SMS, emails, and Tweets, allowing users, employees, and managers to create inquiries and post updates seamlessly.
                SMS messages processed by the system are restricted to 140 characters and may include textspeak abbreviations, which are automatically expanded to their full forms to ensure clarity and professionalism. Email functionality is robust, supporting both standard emails and Significant Incident Reports (SIRs) from branch managers. SIRs follow a structured format, detailing the branch sort code and the nature of the incident, thus providing consistent and thorough documentation of serious events. For security, embedded URLs in emails are quarantined and replaced with placeholders.
